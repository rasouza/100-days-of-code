# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started prototyping the app's layout.

**Thoughts:** Getting along with the template wasn't big deal since it already came developed under Angular. Still need to match the template's colors with my personal logo

### Day 2: March 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to add Material Datepicker lib

**Thoughts:** I struggled with including some 3rd parties' lib such as Material Design 2 (Datepicker). Maybe tomorrow I'll fix it or drop it

### Day 3: March 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed MD2 Datepicker

**Thoughts:** After some research, I found out it was as easy as including Angular's `FormsModule` to my module. Also I customized the datepicker to show only the button and open it through it.

### Day 4: March 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added services to communicate with the API

**Thoughts:** I thought that would be much harder to create a form-submit feature, but Angular really makes it easy

### Day 5: March 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rendered the timeline based on a service

**Thoughts:** I'm mocking the stories since I don't have the API up and running yet. Maybe tomorrow will have my hands on it. However, mocking data is usefull to check if your Angular code is right. Still need to implement automated tests

### Day 6: March 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed theme's color and listed all my Github repos

**Thoughts:** Today I created a service, changed template's theme and included a 3rd party library all on my own. Previously, It took me a whole week and several hours of watching tutorials to accomplish it all. Tomorrow I'll start creating the backend API.

### Day 7: March 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created API and implemented OAuth2

**Thoughts:** I started the API since my Angular app is lacking backend functionality, implemented OAuth2 for GitHub on it but I have no idea on how to make it work in Angular

### Day 8: March 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Surveyed better ways to develop under CI approach

**Thoughts:** Since I develop not only at home but also at work, serving an Backend app in a specific language would slow down development due to app setup. I switched to Continuous Integration to speed up development while having all tech ready wherever I decide to code. I took the day off to search for a good and viable cloud solution for this issue.

### Day 9: March 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Played with Virtualmin to learn more about hosting management

**Thoughts:** I found myself using Google Cloud Engine because of their free plans and easy to setup workflow. Although their compute resources on free plan are pretty low (0.2 vCPU and 0.6Gb RAM), that was enough to set up an use case. If I could get to know Virtualmin better I could migrate to DigitalOcean as my main server hosting apps with Virtualmin. The outcome was positive.

### Day 10: March 21th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Struggled with CI solutions

**Thoughts:** After setting a VPS up, I went on choosing a CI solutions. There were plenty of them available (Travis, Codefresh, Codeship, AWS, etc.) but I had to find one that I could easily deploy to a custom VPS after building and testing steps. Travis were the most friendly UI that I found but still had some issues with custom deploy. Codeship offered the best solution with ready-to-use SSH deploy key and GitHub commit integration

**Link to work:** None

### Day 11: March 22th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup Codeship CI 

**Thoughts:** There were some little things specific to CI that took me some time to learn like database integration, container images, env variables inside Laravel app, etc. I had to code custom scripts to set up the test steps and another one for custom deploy. I learned a bit from it all, interesting day.

### Day 12: March 23th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote test cases and initiated Git-flow 

**Thoughts:** Now that every commit on master will trigger a new build on Codeship, I had to implement test cases to make sure that my code is working when automatic deploy runs. To make things easier, I started using git-flow to better manage branch features and releases.

### Day 13: March 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally integrated Diary API with Angular 

**Thoughts:** Frontend make calls to API backend and it's able to write one story and retrive all of them at once. There's a bug when sending Javascript Date objects as JSON because JS Date format is different from PHP's and it can't parse alone.

### Day 14: March 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed bug that couldn't send Date objects to API 

**Thoughts:** Among all of the solutions I was looking for something that would leave my Angular code's readability untouched. There was an approach which would remodel Story class' date member as String instead of Date object but I didn't choose this way. It took me some time until I wrote a mutator for Story model in the backend.

### Day 15: March 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved User Experience and Feedback 

**Thoughts:** I changed the place of some form inputs in Write form so user can be sure when he's writing for, created a notification which tell whether everything went ok and created table to list user's repositories. Next step is to integrate OAuth in the app

### Day 16: March 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to consume OAuth API with more than 1 endpoint 

**Thoughts:** I've been struggling on how I should consume some Github endpoints to fetch different data for months and now I finally understood how it should work. Actually, I created some endpoints in my backend API that consumes (thanks to Guzzle lib) Github endpoints and forward the access token placed in frontend's localStorage

### Day 17: March 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed the way I consume Github API endpoints 

**Thoughts:** It was a little bit unclear how I should keep client access token in frontend so I could make calls. Today I figured out that I don't need a backend API for every Github stuff. In fact, I just need it because GitHub doesn't support Implicit Flow (that's what I learned today). I still need it to store app-specific data.

### Day 18: March 31th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Used some Angular template syntax to get a more fluent UX 

**Thoughts:** Particularly to Settings page, the User could not yet have been logged in the app therefore, there should be no repositories listing. I used some Angular conditionals, classes binding and event handling to show only data that is interesting to the user at that moment (hiding list, centering cards, etc.)

### Day 19: April 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Integrated Twitter OAuth

**Thoughts:** Twitter integration was harder 'cause its OAuth API is still in version 1.0a. I didn't know it was way harder to make requests in this version.

### Day 20: April 2st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created auto-tweeting

**Thoughts:** A very interesting feature for users that synced their twitter account with Programming Diary app. The write form asks if you want to tweet as soon as you submit your story. Still need to check the day index to prepend in tweet
